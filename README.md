### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I am Khandaker Nusaiba Hafiz, doing my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from University of California, Riverside.  
I am currently a Ph.D. fellow in Bionic Lab of Bourns College of Engineering and working with Dr. Jonathan Realmuto. 
### Research Interest
My Ph.D. research is focused on Virtual Reality, Human-Computer interaction, and Mechanical Impedance of Human body. 
I also have interest in game development and child psychology on cognitive learning at an early age. 
As an aeronautical engineer, I am still fascinated by aircrafts!!!
